# To Do

- Create grid.
- Background image:
  - On top for small screens.
  - Entire background for large screens.
    - Fixed position.
    - Image doesn't go wider than 1920px.
- Set fluid font sizes.
- Set all (fluid) spacing.
- Radio buttons:
  - Vertically center the radio buttons (when text wrap has to occur).
  - Don't let text wrap underneath the radio buttons.
- Hover effects for radio buttons/labels.
- Create nicer colors than just green and red for correct/incorrect answers.
