# To Do

- Create grid.
- Background image:
  - On top for small screens.
  - Entire background for large screens. (But image doesn't go wider than 1920px.)
- Set fluid font sizes.
- Set all (fluid) spacing.
- Vertically center the radio buttons (when text wrap has to occur).
- Hover effects for radio buttons/labels.
- Create nicer colors than just green and red for correct/incorrect answers.
